        <h1>Berlin</h1>
        <p>
          Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the
          city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial
          and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War,
          its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of
          reunification.

          The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet
          Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern
          Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II

          The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the
          gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.
          Berlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt
          Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin), the Technische Universität Berlin
          (TU Berlin), the Freie Universität Berlin (Free University of Berlin),
          the Universität der Künste (University of the Arts, UdK), ESMT Berlin
          and the Berlin School of Economics and Law. Its Zoological Garden is
          the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide.
          With the world's oldest large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an
          increasingly popular location for international film productions.[22]
          The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture,
          nightlife, contemporary arts and a very high quality of living.[23]
          Since the 2000s Berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan
          entrepreneurial scene.[24]
